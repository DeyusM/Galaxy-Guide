    gravity: "3.7 m/s²",
    distFromSun: "57.9 million km",
    desc: "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. With almost no atmosphere to trap heat, temperatures swing drastically—from blistering hot in the day to freezing cold at night. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling our Moon."

    type: "Terrestrial",
    gravity: "8.87 m/s²",
    distFromSun: "108.2 million km",
    desc: "Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfuric acid. This causes an extreme greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet, even hotter than Mercury. Its surface pressure is strong enough to crush a submarine."

    distFromSun: "149.6 million km",
    desc: "Earth is the only known planet to support life. It has vast oceans, protective atmosphere, and a diverse climate. Our planet is home to millions of species and is unique for its liquid water, which covers about 71% of its surface."

    type: "Terrestrial",
    gravity: "3.71 m/s²",
    distFromSun: "227.9 million km",
    desc: "Known as the Red Planet, Mars has dusty landscapes, giant volcanoes like Olympus Mons, and massive canyons. Scientists believe it once had rivers and lakes. Future missions aim to explore whether life once existed there."

    gravity: "24.79 m/s²",
    distFromSun: "778.5 million km",
    desc: "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, famous for its swirling clouds and the Great Red Spot—a storm larger than Earth that’s raged for centuries. It has dozens of moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system."

    distFromSun: "1.43 billion km",
    desc: "Saturn is recognized for its stunning ring system made of ice and rock. It has more than 80 moons, including Titan, which has lakes of methane and ethane. Despite its size, Saturn is so light it could float in water."
