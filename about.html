    <p>
      Planet Explorer is a small educational project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
      It loads a dataset of planets, displays them as interactive cards, and allows you to search for specific planets in real time.  
      This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event listeners, data arrays, and styling with CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s designed to be simple enough for beginners to learn from, but flexible enough to expand—such as adding moons, facts, and even live data from NASA’s APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All planet images are from NASA and Unsplash, free to use for educational purposes.
